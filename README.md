Generative differential growth in JavaScript

An attempt to create in JavaScript the [shepherding random growth][Inconvergent-shepherding] algorithm of Inconvergent. This leads to beautiful and biological shapes, like the art work [Differential Line][inconvergent-diff-line]. The theoretical background is called [Morphogenesis][wikipedia-morphogenesis].

One of my goals is also to make it interactive.
